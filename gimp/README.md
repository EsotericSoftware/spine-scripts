## Installation

* GIMP must be installed with Python plugin support.

* If you don't have a `Filters` > `Python-Fu` menu, you don't have Python plugin support and will need to reinstall GIMP.

* Choose any plugin directory which has a green circle when selected and move the `GimpToSpine.py` script file to that directory.
* Unix (Linux, Mac) users need to set the executable flag on the GimpToSpine.py file (e.g. via `chmod +x GimpToSpine.py`)
* Users having installed GIMP via flatpak may find the plug-ins folder at `/var/lib/flatpak/app/org.gimp.GIMP/current/active/files/lib/gimp/2.0/plug-ins`
* Restart GIMP.

## Usage

After installation, choose `Export to Spine` under the `File` menu.

It can be helpful to create a Gimp Keyboard Shortcut that runs the script. A function key can be specified for the action, allowing the script to be run with a single key press.
A new Keyboard Shortcut can be set under the `Edit` menu. Just search for Spine in the Keyboard Shortcut window.

## Tags
