# Photoshop to Spine

This script supports the latest version of Photoshop CC and all older versions of Photoshop back to CS2.

An alternative to an expensive Photoshop CC subscription is to use Photoshop Elements, which is a one-time purchase. It is a reduced functionality version of Photoshop intended for photographers, but supports the most often used features (clipping masks, adjusments layers, etc) and may be sufficient for your needs.

Another option is that Adobe has made [CS2 available for download](https://www.google.com/search?q=photoshop%20cs2%20download), though they ask that only those who legitimately purchased CS2 use it.

## Download

To download the script, left click this link: [PhotoshopToSpine.jsx](https://esotericsoftware.com/spine-scripts/PhotoshopToSpine.jsx) (do not right click and "save as", do not click a different link above). Make sure the extension of the file you are saving is `.jsx`. If you use the link in the list of files above, you may mistakenly save a web page.

To see the Spine logo on the dialog, you may optionally click [logo.png](https://esotericsoftware.com/spine-scripts/logo.png) and save the logo image in the same folder as the script file.

## Install

Navigate to the Photoshop installation folder, then choose the folder `Presets`, then `Scripts`. On Windows the path is likely similar to this:
```
C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CC 2019\Presets\Scripts
```

Copy the files `PhotoshopToSpine.jsx` (and optionally `logo.png`) inside the `Scripts` folder, then restart Photoshop.

## Usage
The script can be run by choosing `File` > `Scripts` > `PhotoshopToSpine` in Photoshop.

If you didn't copy the files in the Photoshop directory, the script can also be run by choosing `File` > `Scripts` > `Browse` in Photoshop.

The script can also be run by dragging the file to Photoshop window's menu bar or toolbar if you're using Photoshop v19 or earlier.

It can be helpful to create a Photoshop action that runs the script. A function key can be specified for the action, allowing the script to be run with a single key press.

* `Ignore hidden layers` Hidden groups and layers are not output.
* `Ignore background layer` The background layer is not output.
* `Trim whitespace` When checked, whitespace around the edges of each layer is removed. When unchecked, all images are the size of the PSD.
* `Write Spine JSON` A JSON file is written that can be imported into Spine.
* `Write template image` An image containing the currently visible layers is created for use as a template for positioning in Spine.
* `Scale` Scales the layers before writing the image files. This is useful when using higher resolution art in Photoshop than you want to use in Spine.
* `Padding` The number of pixels around each image. This can avoid aliasing artifacts for opaque pixels along the image edge.
* `Images output path` The folder where the images files will be written.
* `JSON output path` If ending in `.json`, the JSON file that will be  written. Otherwise, the folder where the JSON file will be written, using the name of the PSD file.

## Origin

The Photoshop ruler origin corresponds to 0,0 in Spine, allowing you to control the position of your skeleton in Spine.

Photoshop may reset your ruler position when you close your PSD. We suggest creating guides where you want the ruler so you can easily it to that exact position.

## Tags

Tags in square brackets can be used in layer and group names to customize the output. The tags can be anywhere in the name, for example `head [slot]` or `[slot] head`. If `:name` is omitted, the layer or group name is used.

**Group and layer names:**
* `[bone]` or `[bone:name]`  Layers, slots, and bones are placed under a bone. The bone is created at the center of a visible layer. Bone groups can be nested.
* `[slot]` or `[slot:name]`  Layers are placed in a slot.
* `[skin]` or `[skin:name]`  Layers are placed in a skin. Skin layer images are output in a subfolder for the skin.
* `[scale:number]`  Layers are scaled. Their attachments are scaled inversely, so they appear the same size in Spine.
* `[folder]` or `[folder:name]`  Layer images are output in a subfolder. Folder groups can be nested.
* `[ignore]` Layers, groups, and any child groups will not be output.

**Group names:**
* `[merge]` Layers in the group are merged and a single image is output.

**Layer names:**
* The layer name is used for the attachment or skin placeholder name, relative to any parent `[skin]` or `[folder]` groups. Can contain `/` for subfolders.
* `[path:name]` Specifies the image file name for the layer, if it needs to be different from the attachment name. Can be used on a group with `[merge]`.

If a layer name, folder name, or path name starts with `/` then parent layers won't affect the name.

## Skin folders

If a skin name contains forward slashes (`/`) then the skin will appear within folders in Spine. For example, `a/b/skin` will show in Spine as folders `a` and `b` with a skin named `skin`.

## Blending modes

The script will recognize the following blending modes applied to a folder or layer. The slot in Spine will have the corresponding blending mode.

* `Normal` corresponds to the `Normal` blending mode in Spine.
* `Multiply` corresponds to the `Multiply` blending mode in Spine.
* `Screen` corresponds to the `Screen` blending mode in Spine.
* `Linear Dodge` corresponds to the `Additive` blending mode in Spine.

## Adjustment layers

Adjustment layers can be used in Photoshop and are automatically applied to the generated images, without having to apply or merge them to each layer below them.

## Reveal all

By default all layers are cropped by the canvas size. If you would like to have some layers partially or completely outside the canvas but exported without being cropped, you can edit the script to do so. Find this line of code:
```
//activeDocument.revealAll();
```
Change it to:
```
activeDocument.revealAll();
```
Note you will need to repeat this edit if you get a new version of the script.

## Debugging

When the script fails with an error, it can be useful to debug the script to determine which line in the script is failing. A script should never be able to crash Photoshop, no matter what it does, but sometimes Photoshop has bugs and debugging can be used to find which line the in script causes Photoshop to crash.

Debugging requires the [Adobe ExtendScript Toolkit](https://www.adobe.com/products/extendscript-toolkit.htmlESTK). [Older versions](https://www.adobe.com/devnet/scripting/estk.html) are also available. Windows mirrors: [3.5](https://esotericsoftware.com/files/AdobeExtendScriptToolkit3.5.0-mul.zip) and [4.0](https://esotericsoftware.com/files/AdobeExtendScriptToolkit4-LS22.exe). macOS mirror: [4.0](https://esotericsoftware.com/files/AdobeExtendScriptToolkit4-LS22.exe)

Run ExtendScript, then check `Debug > Do not break on guarded exceptions`. That means when a script is run, ExtendScript won't stop when an error occurs that the script handles ("guards"). In a few places it is normal that the script tries something, catches any error that occurs, then carries on, so you don't want ExtendScript stopping every time that happens. ExtendScript will still stop if an error occurs that the script doesn't catch.

Next, with Photoshop running, open the script file in ExtendScript and run the script using `Debug > Run` or `F5`. The script will run as normal, but if an error occurs ExtendScript will stop on the problematic line. Knowing which line causes the script to fail is very useful.

If Photoshop crashes, run the script again but this time use `Debug > Step Into` or `F11` to run line by line. Continue pressing `F11` to run each line and note the last line it was on when Photoshop crashes. Alternatively, `Debug > Step Over` or `F10` can be used to run a whole line without going into the functions called. It can be much faster to execute whole lines like this to get to later in the script where the crash happens.
